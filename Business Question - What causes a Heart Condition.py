#quick look at data types
heart.info()

##An initial look at the dataset shows it has 303 observations which corresponds 
#to 303 patients and 14 different feature variables.

#Some of the variables like sex, cp(chest pain type), or the target variable are in 
#the wrong data type integers and will 
#need to be converted to categorical variables before any analysis/machine learning carried out.

## Understanding the Data

Origin of Data: Kaggle

Domain background on heart disease and what each feature variable means

Initially, the dataset contains 76 features or attributes from 303 patients; however, published studies chose only 14 features that are relevant in predicting heart disease. Hence, here we will be using the dataset consisting of 303 patients with 14 features set.

Selection bias might be an issue with data as sample might bot be representative of the population of cardiac patients in Cleveland or even America/World. This selection bias can result in erroneous conclusions.

age of patient in years

sex of patient (1 = male; 0 = female)

Cp: chest pain type (4 values) -(0 = typical angina; 1 = atypical angina; 2 = non-anginal pain; 3 = asymptomatic)

Trestbps: resting blood pressure  (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

Chol: serum cholesterol in mg/dl

Fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)

Restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)  (0 = normal; 1 = having ST-T; 2 = hypertrophy)

Thalac: maximum heart rate achieved 

Exang: exercise induced angina  (1 = yes; 0 = no)

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment  

Ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy

thal : a blood disorder called thalasemia [1 = normal, 2 = fixed defect, 3 = reversible defect]

Target : whether patient has a heart condition (1) or not (0)

# 
# Introduction
# 
# In order to answer the question of what causes a heart condition, heavy domain expertise on heart disease is required. This is because understanding what the variables actually measure and how they are measured is vital in determining causes of heart disease. 
# 
# According to the NHS website (reference: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronary-heart-disease/), Coronary Heart disease (CHD) is responsible for a large number of deaths globally. Another name is Ischaemic Heart diesease.
# 
# With the prevalence of coronavirus, the British Heart Foundation (BHF https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/news/coronavirus-and-your-health) has declared that patients with a heart disease are more at risk of complications from coronavirus.
