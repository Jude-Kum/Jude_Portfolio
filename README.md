# DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS

[Project 1: Predicting heart disease in patients.](https://github.com/Judedatascientist/Jude_Portfolio)

## Objective: Predict patients with heart disease.

. Used exploratory tools to identify factors that discriminate betwwen heart disease patients and those without heart disease.

. Using logistic regression and random forest algorithms to predict patients with heart disease condition.

### Brief Overview
The dataset is a UCI Machine learning Repository dataset that is publically available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci "Please click")

#### Domain expertise 

In order to predict heart disease in patients, heavy domain expertise through years of medical experience in cardiology is required. This is because understanding what the variables actually measure and how they are measured is vital in diagnosing heart disease.
