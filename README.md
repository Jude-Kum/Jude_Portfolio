Introduction

In order to answer the question of what causes a heart condition, heavy domain expertise on heart disease is required. This is because understanding what the variables actually measure and how they are measured is vital in determining causes of heart disease.

According to the NHS website (reference: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronary-heart-disease/), Coronary Heart disease (CHD) is responsible for a large number of deaths globally. Another name is Ischaemic Heart diesease.

With the prevalence of coronavirus, the British Heart Foundation (BHF https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/news/coronavirus-and-your-health) has declared that patients with a heart disease are more at risk of complications from coronavirus.
